Welcome to "GetTheFlag"

To run the game launch the file: run_game.py in folder src

If you have Josticks, connect them before starting the game.
We recomend to use a playstation-like joypad.
If the joypad is not recognized (see console message),
you can configure it by editing joyConfig.txt in the data folder.
To get the name of your Joystick, the number of the buttons and axis,
run Joytest.py in folder src

You can find more detailed explainations in the controls sections 
in the report attached.

Hope you will enjoy it!!!

The developers, Claudio and Olivier.
